#Description:
A group of 3 people was given an assignment to write a poem about a sheep and save it into a file about_a_sheep.txt.
Alice started first, then Bob and Simon modified her copy independently.
You know that each of them made some useful (or not so useful) contribution to the text but you must sum their efforts into a single text.
Using GIT, create a separate branch for each collaborator with their commit.
Try to switch between branches and make sure that each contain a different version of the same file (about_a_sheep.txt). Last, try to merge Bob's and Simon's branches into Alice's (master) - it might be a bit complicated (merge conflict).

Try to imagine how you'd do this task without GIT, what if it was a 500-line poem?
